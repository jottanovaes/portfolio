      <p>
        So, I started out in biology, but guess what? I stumbled upon my real
        passion: algorithms and coding! I completed the FullStack Trybe course,
        and now I&apos;m on my way as a Frontend Developer, still learning the
        ropes, but loving every minute of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        But hey, work isn&apos;t everything! I&apos;m also a super enthusiastic
        volunteer at ‚ÄúArboreser RP‚Äù. Time just flies by when I&apos;m there.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you know what I&apos;m really passionate about? Teaching! I
        discovered my love for it during my Computer Science BSc at IFNMG. Being
        a teacher brings me so much joy! ü§ì
